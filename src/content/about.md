I'm Junghwa Yang, a self-motivated <span>Full-stack Software Engineer</span> using MERN stack living in beautiful Sydney. 🏝 I enjoy building software that makes our lives better and I love solving problems that challenge me.

This site is my <span>digital garden</span> 🌱, a collection of the things I have learned during my journey to become a full-stack developer from scratch without a CS degree. When I learn something, I usually take digital notes that I can summarize in my words, and whenever I need them, I come back to those notes and learn again from past me.

## My Story

I'm from a Business and Accounting background, and while working as an accountant, I learned coding as a hobby at first, and I fell in love with programming. At some point, I decided to dive into it seriously and pursue my passion. And now I'm happier with my career than ever before. 🥰

I studied Data Science first as I love math and number things and worked as a <span>data scientist</span> for a year. To deal with data, I felt the need to know about server-side programming and started learning gradually. And I found more interest in software development, so I started a new journey again to become a back-end developer. And after learning front-end skills to build this website, I love front-end as well, so... I thought why not be a full-stack? I LOVE web development! Let me be more ambitious. 😜

I'm 100% self-taught and I have huge eager and thirst for new knowledge and experiences. One lesson I learned through this journey is that I could learn new things very quickly and how to find resources to learn and make them mine.

While I’m not coding or in front of the screen, you can find me dancing in Zumba class 💃🏻, playing Badminton 🏸, working out 💪, trekking in nature ⛰, drinking beer 🍺, or Somaek (mixed with soju and beer) or traveling around the world 🌏.
