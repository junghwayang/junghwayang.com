> Written in Python.

- Used to map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements.
- Data is stored in an <span>array</span> format, where each data value has its own **unique index** value.
  - Address or the index value is generated from a hash function.
  - That makes accessing the data faster as the index value behaves as a key for the data value.
- Hash table stores key-value pairs, but the key is generated through a hashing function.
- Accessing data becomes very fast with the index of data.

## Linear Probing

If the hashing creates an already used index of the array,

→ Search the next empty location in the array.

## Basic Operations

- <span>Search</span>
- <span>Insert</span>
- <span>Delete</span>

## Big-O Complexity for Hash Table

- Time complexity
  - Insertion/Deletion: O(1)
  - Search: O(1)
- Space complexity: O(n)

## Implementation

- <span>Dictionary</span> data types represent the implementation of hash tables in Python.
- Keys of the dictionary are **hashable**.

→ generated by hashing function which generates unique result for each unique value.

- The order of data elements in a dictionary is not fixed.

```python
# Declare a dict
dict = {
  'Name': 'Happy',
  'Age': 3,
  'Breed': 'Golden Retriever'
}

# Access values with its key
>>> dict['Name']
Happy
>>> dict['Age']
3

# Update dict
dict['Age'] = 5
dict['Color'] = 'Golden'

>>> dict['Age']
5
>>> dict['Color']
Golden

# Delete dict elements
del dict['Color']   # Delete entry with key 'Color'
dict.clear()        # Delete all entries in dict
del dict            # Delete entire dict
```
