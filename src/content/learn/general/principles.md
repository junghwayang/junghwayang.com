## SOLID

5 important design principles when doing OOP(Object Oriented Programming).

- **S** : Single responsibility principle
  - A class should have only one reason to change.
  - Gather together things that change for the same reasons.
- **O** : Open/closed principle
  - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **L** : Liskov substitution principle
  - The sub-types must be replaceable for super-types without breaking the program execution.
- **I** : Interface segregation principle
  - Clients should not be forced to depend upon the interfaces that they don't use.
- **D** : Dependency inversion principle
  - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.

## KISS = Keep It Simple, Stupid

Most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated.

## YAGNI = You Aren't Gonna Need It

Don't add functionality until you need it.

## DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself

Reduce repetition of code blocks
