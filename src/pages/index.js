        <p>I'm a <span className='emphasized'>Full-stack Software Engineer</span> using <b>MERN</b> stack living in beautiful Sydney. üèù I enjoy building software that makes our lives better and I love solving problems that challenge me.</p>

        <p>This site is my <span className='emphasized'>digital garden</span> üå±, a collection of the things I have learned during my journey to become a full-stack developer from scratch without a CS degree. When I learn something, I usually take digital notes that I can summarize in my words, and whenever I need them, I come back to those notes and learn again from past me.</p>

        <p>Personally, I prefer writing in short as much as I can. Sometimes when I read others' blogs, it's too tiring to read rambling explanations and flowery words. I could say I understand well if I can explain in short, and it helps me to go through quickly when I search for some information I need. I've tried to keep it in the way like a well-summarized notes and it will look different than other writings.</p>
